# MobilePhoneChallenge
Java ArrayList Challenge from Tim Buchalka's Java Masterclass


## Outline

Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities:
* Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names
 * You will want to create a separate class for contacts (name and phone number)
 * create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds the arrayList of contacts
 * the MobilePhone class has the functionality listed above
 * add a menu of options that are available 
 * Options: quit, print list of contacts, add new conctact, update existing contacts and search/find contact
 * when adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exists
 * be sure not to expose the inner workings of the arrayList to mobile phone
 *  e.g. no ints, no .get(i), etc
 * mobilePhone  should do everything with contact objects only
